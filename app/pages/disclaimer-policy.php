                                        <strong>Introduction</strong>
                                        <p>This Disclaimer Policy governs your use of the Hagidy marketplace platform ("Hagidy Technologies (Hagidy)", "we", "our", "us"). By accessing or using Hagidy's website, mobile application, or related services (collectively 'Platform'), you acknowledge and agree to the disclaimers outlined below. If you do not accept this Disclaimer Policy, you should not use our services.</p>

                                        <strong>Marketplace Role</strong>
                                        <p>Hagidy is an online marketplace platform that connects independent vendors ('Sellers') with consumers ('Buyers'). Hagidy itself is not the manufacturer, producer, or seller of most products listed on the platform (unless explicitly specified on certain listings). All products, descriptions, images, specifications, warranties, and claims are provided directly by the respective vendors. Hagidy facilitates transactions and logistics support but does not own, produce, or endorse vendor products.</p>

                                        <strong>Product Information</strong>
                                        <p>While Hagidy requires sellers to provide accurate and lawful product information, we do not guarantee that product listings, images, prices, descriptions, or specifications will be accurate, reliable, complete, or error-free at all times. Packaging, product labeling, warnings, and instructions may differ from what is displayed on the platform. We strongly advise buyers to read labels, warnings, and directions provided with the product before use and not rely solely on information displayed on Hagidy.</p>

                                        <strong>Warranties and Liability</strong>
                                        <p>Unless otherwise stated, Hagidy makes no express or implied warranties or representations regarding:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The quality, safety, durability, merchantability, or fitness for the purpose of any product.</li>
                                            <li>The accuracy or reliability of vendor-provided information.</li>
                                            <li>The uninterrupted or error-free operation of the platform.</li>
                                            <li>Any warranties, guarantees, or after-sales obligations are provided directly by the respective seller or manufacturer.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Hagidy will not be held liable for damages, injuries, or losses (direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential) arising from the use of products purchased on the platform.</p>

                                        <strong>Cashback and Rewards</strong>
                                        <p>Hagidy's cashback and community rewards are subject to verification, eligibility, and compliance with platform policies. Cashback may be withheld, canceled, or adjusted in cases of fraud, misuse, failed transactions, product returns, or policy violations. Hagidy does not guarantee the continuity of cashback programs, which may be modified or withdrawn at any time with prior notice.</p>

                                        <strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
                                        <p>Hagidy may integrate or rely on third-party service providers (e.g., payment gateways, logistics partners, KYC agencies). While we strive to work with trusted partners, Hagidy is not responsible for:</p>

                                            <li>Hagidy shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, goodwill, data, or business opportunities.</li>
                                            <li>Users agree that their sole remedy against Hagidy for dissatisfaction with products, services, or platform use is to discontinue using the platform.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <strong>Indemnification</strong>
                                        <p>Users (buyers and sellers) agree to indemnify and hold harmless Hagidy, its affiliates, employees, directors, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses (including legal fees) arising out of:</p>

                                            <li>Breach of warranties, representations, or obligations by sellers.</li>
                                            <li>Infringement of third-party rights or laws.</li>
                                        </ul>
